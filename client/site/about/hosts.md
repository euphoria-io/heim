# Room Host Policy  *updated Oct 23, 2015*


Staff are available to help you. If you have any questions or need any
assistance, please [contact us](mailto:help@euphoria.io). You can also ask for
general advice in [&townhall](https://euphoria.io/room/townhall).


## Responsibility

By creating a chat room, you agree to act as the administrator ("**host**") of
it and to take the responsibility to moderate the room. You agree to exclude
any participant that you believe to be in violation of Euphoria’s [Terms of
Service](https://euphoria.io/about/terms) and you agree to [notify Euphoria
staff](mailto:help@euphoria.io) about the situation. If someone reports any
content of your chat as illegal or otherwise in breach of our terms, you will
be responsible for letting Euphoria staff know, and where necessary, taking the
content down.


## Conduct

Additionally, it is your responsibility to ensure the rooms you host abide by
our [Code of Conduct](https://euphoria.io/about/conduct). Room hosts are
currently granted significant discretion in how they enforce the Code of
Conduct (e.g. deleting a comment versus banning a user). However, if a staff
member feels that your room is in breach of the Code of Conduct, they may take
administrative action, including but not limited to:

 * A friendly discussion about the issue.

 * Revocation of host privileges.

 * Shutting down rooms.

We will do our best to work with you and give opportunity to correct issues
rather than shutting down a room.


## Changes

Euphoria is currently in its early stages, our rules and guidance will change
in the future.
