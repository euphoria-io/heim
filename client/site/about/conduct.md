# Euphorian Code of Conduct  *updated April 12th, 2016*


## Purpose

The main goal of Euphoria is to be inclusive to the largest number of
people, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. It's important
to us to provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everybody,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, race, or
socioeconomic status.

We invite all those who participate on Euphoria to help us create safe and
positive experiences for everyone.
Remember: there is a human on the other side of the screen.


## Rules

To help us achieve these goals, the following behaviors are not allowed:

 * Threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.

 * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, or otherwise discriminatory jokes, 
   insults, or language.

 * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
   information ("doxing") or posting of non-harassing private communication
   without consent.

 * Inappropriate sexual attention or unwelcome sexual advances. Misreading the
   tone of the situation isn't an excuse.

 * Deliberate intimidation or stalking.

 * Creating rooms for porn, or gratuitous posting of porn. While conversations
   of a sexual nature may occur in some spaces, Euphoria is not a porn site.

 * Spamming, flooding, or unauthorized advertising.

 * Maliciously impersonating any real person or entity, including but not
   limited to a Euphoria staff member or volunteer, or otherwise
   misrepresenting your affiliation with any person or entity.

 * Breaking Euphoria, making it so others can’t use the site, or using Euphoria
   to break other sites or services.

 * Bypassing access restrictions, evading bans, or tampering with data that has
   not been intentionally granted to you.

 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.


## Consequences

We may take various actions to enforce this Code of Conduct, such as:

 * Asking the user to stop the behavior in question.

 * Removing chat privileges for a period of time.

 * Stripping control of a room from a user and/or shutting it down.

 * Temporarily limiting what rooms a user is allowed to participate in.

 * Temporarily or permanently banning a user from Euphoria.


## Reporting

If you are subject to or witness behavior that violates these guidelines, or if
you have any other concerns or questions, please [contact
us](mailto:help@euphoria.io).


## Addressing grievances
If you feel you have been unfairly sanctioned, please send us an
[email](mailto:help@euphoria.io) with a concise description of your
grievance. We'll respond within three days to offer our rationale
and discuss any disciplinary decisions.
